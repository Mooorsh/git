        <p>Many of my hobbies include the outdoors. Hiking, skiing, and climbing are all things I love. In these pictures below show only a snippet
          of my adventure I have been on. For example, the picture of me laying in a hammock was in Vail Pass. The most beautiful camping in the nation.
          I love being able to step away from everyday life and just relax. Just you, the outdoors, some great campfire food, and the the beautiful night sky. Another
          one of my hobbies that I have just started getting into is climbing. Well not so much the actual climbing itself but the repelling part. Being able to slowly go
          down a face of a rock is so thrilling. You get to see every inch of the rock, and all the adrenaline that comes with it. Lastly, many of the pictures below show some of the outfits
          I wear. Fashion is very important to me, being able to express myself through clothing is so fun.
