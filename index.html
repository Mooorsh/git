        <h2>My Goals in Life</h2>
        <p class="goals">Hi my name is Skyla Atkins. My main goals in life are to become a police officer, buy a house in the next couple of years, and to own a brand new Toyota 4 runner.
          I'm currently going through the police academy, and look forward to graduating soon. So i can check off one of those goals here soon Some personal accomplishments I have are
          finishing my degree in criminal justice. Owning a cute cat names Bentley. And living in one of the greatest places on earth Breckenridge Colorado. Where I get to ski!</p>

        <h2>Embellishments</h2>
        <p class="Embellishments">Some details about me are that I love the outdoors. It is one of my favorite places to me. If I'm ever having a bad day, a nice walk in the wood always cheers me up.
          I grew up in Iowa, so having humongous mountains and clear blue rivers around me wasn't always in the cars. I also love animals, I have a cat named Bentley after the great
          artist POST MALONE. His music is so relaxing so what better name to give a cat than someone who makes you feel happy. Lastly, I really hate olives. For some reason
          they just freak me out. Sometimes I even gag to the thought of them. I know it's pretty weird, but it's just like if someone hates hearing the sound of nails on a chalk board.</p>
