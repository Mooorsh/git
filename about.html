        <h2>A little About Me</h2>
        <p> Born in Grand Forks, North Dakota I grew up in a great family with loving parents and a silly younger brother.
          Both of my parents served in the United States Air Force, which caused us to move around a lot.
          I have lived in many places over the course of my life. Even spent a couple years in Germany!
          Towards the end of my fathers military career we ended up in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Where I graduated highschool,
          and played soccer which gave me opportunities to continue my education at Winona University. Where I graduated with
          a Bachelors in Criminal Justice. After college and a whole lot of school. I wanted to travel a bit and experience life.
          I moved to Breckenridge CO, and fell in love with the mountains. After working as a "lifty" for awhile for Vail Resorts. I wanted to pursue my dream of
          becoming a police officer. Luckily I was fortunate enough to get sponsored by the Breckenridge police department to attend their police academy. Which I can proudly
          say I graduated from. Life is a journey, and I always think the hardest times in your life should be considered a blessing. Because those
          moments are what makes us... us. Remember to follow your dreams, and always appreciate the little moments on your big journey. Because before you know it
          the opportunities won't always be there. So go out a grab it!
